# Creativity Kernel

This is the main repository of the Creativity Kernel. There are two components
to this project, the service is in the folder aptly named backend, and the front
end application is in the folder named client.

The backend is a standard express service, while the front end uses create react
app. See the individual `package.json` for more information.

Currently, the database runs on a mongoose instance hosted on a third party cloud
service. TODO: make database connections local, bootstrappable and resettable.
